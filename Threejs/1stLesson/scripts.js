//1. scene
//2. objects
//3. camera
//4. renderer

//setup the scene

//scene is like a container where we store all the objects

//camera is like a human eye that sees the scene

//renderer is like a screen that displays the scene

/*what is mesh?
mesh is a combination of geometry and material
why do we need mesh?
mesh is used to create a 3D object from a geometry and material
geometry is like the shape of the object
material is like the color of the object
mesh is like the object itself
